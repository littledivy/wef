wef ("Web embedded framework") lets you build cross platform apps using web
technologies with your choice of browser engine.

### How it works

wef is built around a C ABI that separates browser engines (backends) from
application logic (runtimes). Prebuilt backends for [CEF](./cef) and the
system [WebView](./webview) implement the `wef_backend_api_t` interface
defined in [`capi/include/wef.h`](capi/include/wef.h), and a
[Winit](./winit) backend handles windowing without a web engine. (A
Servo-based backend lives on the [`servo`](https://github.com/littledivy/wef/tree/servo)
branch.)

Runtimes are shared libraries compiled with user application logic. When the
backend starts, it loads the runtime dylib and hands control to the runtime. The
runtime uses the interface to create windows, register JavaScript bindings, and
respond to calls from the web content.

wef also handles bidirectional marshalling that abstracts message passing
between JS and native code. This modular approach leads to fast development and
packaging of wef applications.

```rust
use wef::{Window, Value};

fn main() {
    Window::new(800, 600)
      .title("My App")
      .bind("greet", |call| {
         let name = call.args.get(0)
             .and_then(|v| v.as_string())
             .unwrap_or("World");
         call.resolve(Value::String(format!("Hello, {}!", name)));
      })
      .load_url("https://example.com");
}

wef::main!(main);
```

### Backend matrix

wef ships three backends today. The [CEF](./cef) backend embeds Chromium 144 and
runs a multi-process architecture identical to a full browser — you get the same
renderer, GPU process, and DevTools you would in Chrome, bundled into your app.
The system [WebView](./webview) backend delegates to the platform's native web
engine (WKWebView on macOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux), so the
engine is never bundled and your app stays small. The [Winit](./winit)
backend is engine-free — it creates native windows for apps that draw their
own content (GPU surfaces, custom renderers) without loading a web engine.

An experimental [Servo](https://github.com/littledivy/wef/tree/servo)
backend is preserved on a branch for future work.

| Post UI task              | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |

#### JavaScript interop

| Feature                           | CEF | WebView | Winit |
|-----------------------------------|-----|---------|-------|
| JS call handler (native bindings) | ✅   | ✅       | ❌     |
| Respond to JS calls               | ✅   | ✅       | ❌     |
| Invoke JS callbacks               | ✅   | ✅       | ❌     |
| Release JS callbacks              | ✅   | ✅       | ❌     |
| Custom JS namespace               | ✅   | ✅       | ❌     |
| Execute JS with result callback   | ✅   | ✅       | ❌     |

#### Menus

| Feature          | CEF            | WebView | Winit          |
|------------------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| Application menu | macOS, Windows | ✅       | macOS, Windows |
| Context menu     | ✅              | ✅       | macOS, Windows |
| Open DevTools    | ✅              | ✅       | ❌              |

Context menus work on CEF Linux because `GtkMenu` popups don't need a
GtkWindow container. Application menu on CEF Linux still doesn't work:
a `GtkMenuBar` has to be packed into a GtkWindow above the browser, and
reparenting CEF into a client-owned GtkWindow via `CefWindowInfo::SetAsChild`
breaks on XWayland (cross-client X11 child windows aren't supported
natively by Wayland). OSR would sidestep it but is out of scope. Winit on
Linux has the same constraint.

#### Dock / taskbar

The dock is a macOS concept; on Windows the analog is the taskbar button, on
Linux it's the window-manager urgency hint / title convention.

| Feature         | CEF   | WebView | Winit |
|-----------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Bounce / flash  | ✅     | ✅       | ✅     |
| Badge           | ✅     | ✅       | ✅     |
| Dock menu       | macOS | macOS   | macOS |
| Hide dock icon  | macOS | macOS   | macOS |
| Reopen callback | macOS | macOS   | macOS |

On macOS, the badge uses `NSDockTile.badgeLabel` (native red overlay on the
dock icon). On Windows and Linux, all three backends implement the badge as
a `"(N) "` prefix on the window title — the convention used by Slack, Discord,
Telegram, etc. Taskbars and window managers surface the title, so the badge
appears on the taskbar button / window manager overview. Proper Windows
overlay icons (`ITaskbarList3::SetOverlayIcon`) and Linux libunity counts
are future work. The dock menu, dock visibility, and reopen callback have
no clean cross-platform analog.

#### Tray / status bar

Tray icons are explicitly-created, persistent icons in the OS status area:
macOS menu bar extras (NSStatusItem), Windows system tray
(Shell_NotifyIcon), Linux via libappindicator. Each tray icon has its own
PNG image, tooltip, left-click handler, and right-click menu.

| Feature              | CEF            | WebView        | Winit          |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Tray icon            | ✅              | ✅              | ✅              |
| Tooltip              | macOS, Windows | macOS, Windows | ✅              |
| Right-click menu     | ✅              | ✅              | ✅              |
| Left-click handler   | macOS, Windows | macOS, Windows | ✅              |
| Double-click handler | macOS, Windows | macOS, Windows | ✅              |
| Dark-mode icon       | macOS, Windows | macOS, Windows | macOS, Windows |

CEF on Linux uses libappindicator (the same as WebView); this is independent
of the main browser window, so no GtkWindow is required. On Linux in general
(CEF, WebView, Winit), left-click and double-click are swallowed by the menu
(AppIndicator convention), tooltips are absent from the StatusNotifierItem
spec, and dark-mode icon swapping is left to the DE since libappindicator
renders through the theme.

Dark-mode icon swapping: when both `icon(...)` and `icon_dark(...)` are set,
the backends observe the system appearance (NSDistributedNotificationCenter
`AppleInterfaceThemeChangedNotification` on macOS, `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` /
`ImmersiveColorSet` + `AppsUseLightTheme` registry on Windows) and swap
live. Winit polls once per event-loop tick.

#### Native dialogs

| Feature                        | CEF | WebView | Winit |
|--------------------------------|-----|---------|-------|
| Alert                          | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |
| Confirm                        | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |
| Prompt                         | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |
| Browser JS dialogs (native UI) | ✅   | ✅       | ❌     |

#### Input events

| Feature               | CEF | WebView | Winit |
|-----------------------|-----|---------|-------|
| Keyboard events       | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |
| Mouse click events    | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |
| Mouse move events     | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |
| Wheel / scroll events | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |
| Cursor enter / leave  | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |

#### Window events

| Feature         | CEF | WebView | Winit |
|-----------------|-----|---------|-------|
| Focus / blur    | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |
| Resize          | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |
| Move            | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |
| Close requested | ✅   | ✅       | ✅     |

#### Window handles (GPU surface creation)

| Feature                | CEF | WebView | Winit |
|------------------------|-----|---------|-------|
| Get window handle      | ❌   | ❌       | ✅     |
| Get display handle     | ❌   | ❌       | ✅     |
| Get window handle type | ❌   | ❌       | ✅     |
